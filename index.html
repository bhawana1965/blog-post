            <h3>What is coronavirus</h3>
            <p>
                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus..... <br>
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring 
                special treatment.Older people, and those with the underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic 
                respiratory disease,and cancer are are more likely to develop serious illenss.

            <h3>Details: safety and preventions</h3>
            <p>
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,the disease it causes and how it prevent.
                Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based sanitizer, avoid touching your face.
                <br> <br>
                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
                so it;s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
                <br>
                At this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating 
                potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
